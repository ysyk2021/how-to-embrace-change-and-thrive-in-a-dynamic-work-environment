Individuals who have a growth mindset focus on progress, not perfection. They recognize that success is a journey, not a destination, and that achieving goals and objectives requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to learn from mistakes and failures.

To cultivate a positive attitude towards change, individuals must be willing to accept imperfection and focus on making incremental progress over time.
