Resilience involves developing the skills and attitudes necessary to cope with change and uncertainty. This includes maintaining a positive attitude, staying focused on goals, and being flexible and adaptable in the face of new challenges.

Resilient individuals are able to bounce back from setbacks and adapt quickly to new situations, which can help them to thrive in a dynamic work environment.

Developing coping skills

Developing coping skills takes practice and dedication, but the benefits can be significant.

Adapting to uncertainty and ambiguity
